# hackernews-TUI

`hackernews_tui` is a Terminal UI to browse Hacker News with fully customizable and vim-like key bindings.

`hackernews_tui` is written in Rust with the help of [Cursive TUI library](https://github.com/gyscos/cursive/). It uses [HN Algolia search APIs](https://hn.algolia.com/api/) to get Hacker News data.

The application mainly consists of the following views:

- `Story View` displaying a list of HN stories. There are different kinds of `Story View` depending on the `tag` used to filter stories:
  - `Front Page`: stories on the front-page
  - `All Stories`: all stories
  - `Ask HN`: ask HN stories only
  - `Show HN`: show HN stories only
  - `Jobs`: jobs stories only
- `Article View` displaying the content of a web article in reader mode.
- `Comment View` displaying a list of comments in a story.
- `Search View` displaying a search bar and a list of stories matching the search query.

#### Search View shortcuts

In `SearchView`, there are two modes: `Navigation` and `Search`. The default mode is `Search`.

`Search` mode is similar to Vim's Insert mode, in which users can input the query string.

`Navigation` mode allows the `SearchView` to behave like a `StoryView` with all `StoryView` shortcuts enabled.

Key shortcuts:

- `i`: Enter `Search` mode from `Navigation` mode
- `<esc>`: Enter `Navigation` mode from `Search` mode

`Navigation` mode also supports a subset of `StoryView`'s key shortcuts.

## Configuration

By default, the application will look for `~/.config/hn-tui.toml` as its configuration file.

You can specify the path by specifying the `-c` or `--config` argument when running the application:

```shell
hackernews_tui -c ~/.config/hn-tui.toml
```

For further information about the config options, please refer to the example config file by running `hackernews_tui --example-config`.

**Note**: all config options (as included in the example config file) are **required**. You can run

```shell
hackernews_tui --example-config > ~/.config/hn-tui.toml
```

then modify the config options in `~/.config/hn-tui.toml` based on your preferences.

### Article Parse Command

To enable viewing a web page in reader mode with `Article View`, you must configure the `article_parse_command` field in your configuration file:

``` yaml
# "article_parse_command" defines a command to parse a web article's content
# to a markdown format. The parsed data is then used to render `ArticleView`
# of the corresponding article.
#
# The command must have the following form:
# [article_parse_command] [article_url] [options...]
# It should return a JSON string representing the parsed Article data:
# pub struct Article {
#     title: String,
#     url: String,
#     content: String,
#     author: Option<String>, // optional
#     date_published: Option<String>, // optional
#     word_count: usize, // optional
# }
article_parse_command = {command = "mercury-parser", options = ["--format", "markdown"]}
# article_parse_command = {command = "article_md", options = []}
```

If you don't want to implement an article parser by your own, one way to configure `article_parse_command` is to use [`mercury-parser`](https://github.com/postlight/mercury-parser#installation), a web parser tool that `hackernews_tui` has been using by default since the version `0.6.0`. `mercury-parser` is powerful and stable. However, in some cases, the text content it returns when parsing HTML `code` tags has weird indentation.

Another alternative is to use [`article_md`](https://github.com/aome510/article-md-cli), a CLI package I wrote for parsing article's content into a markdown format. Under the hood, it uses [mozilla's readability](https://github.com/mozilla/readability), so the parsed text content for the HTML `code` tags look nicer.

### User-defined shortcuts

Shortcuts in each `View` are full customizable, for futher information about the supported keys and the corresponding functionalities, please refer to the **user-defined key bindings** sections in the example config file by running `hackernews_tui --example-config`.

### Custom Keymap

It's possible to define a custom shortcut to switch between different kinds of `StoryView` (`front_page`, `show_hn`, `ask_hn`, etc) with stories filtered by HN Algolia's [`numericFilters`](https://hn.algolia.com/api/). An example of defining such a custom shortcut can be found under the **Custom Keymap** section of the example configuration file.

## Debug

Run

```shell
RUST_LOG=debug hackernews_tui 2> log.txt
